When you send a prompt to an agent, the agent doesn't just pass it straight to the model like some lazy middleman. Nope! It constructs a super-prompt by combining your message with additional context \u2014 like the agent's purpose and descriptions of all the tools it has available. This extra context usually shows up as a system prompt (plus structured function definitions for the model to understand).</p> <p>The model input gets built at runtime using your message plus all the stuff the agent's program prescribes. Here's what that looks like in our example:</p> <pre><code>Model input: {\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"system_prompt\",\n            \"text\": \"Your are helpful AI assistant that answer user queries using the data provided by available tools.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"human_prompt\",\n            \"text\": \"What is the temperature of New York?\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"tool_specifications\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_temperature\",\n            \"description\": \"Provides the current temperature of a city\",\n            \"input_schema\": {\n                \"city\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The name of the city\"}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            {\n                \"tool_name\": \"get_total_area\",\n                \"description\": \"Provides the geographical area of a city\",\n                \"input_schema\": {\n                    \"city\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The name of the city\"}\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Each tool definition gets mapped to its corresponding code function in the agent's software program. When the model receives this input, it thinks (well, \"predicts\") and decides, \"Aha!
